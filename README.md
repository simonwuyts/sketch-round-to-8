# Round to 8 Sketch Plugin

I wrote this Sketch Plugin to make designing on an 8 point grid easier by providing two quick actions:

- **Round Size to 8** (<kbd>ctrl + E</kbd>) — round the size of the selected layer to a multiple of 8.
- **Round Position to 8** (<kbd>ctrl + E</kbd>) — round the position of the selected layer to a multiple of 8.

## Installation

Install by downloading the latest release and double clicking it in Finder.

## TODO

[ ] Add support for selecting multiple layers at once.
